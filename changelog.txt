Branch v1.7.2
(11 Feb 2020)
- Merged tx_data and txbuf buffers to save on memory
- Fixed bug on query transmit period for periods >255
- Replaced appending of node ID and loc with a function
- Replaced battery charging state with a function

Branch v1.7.1
(17 Jan 2020)
- Added autostart sensing (through ctrl_flag). Query/change using
'QF'/'DF'[flag value]
- Added FW version information. Query using 'QV'

Branch v1.7
(2 Dec 2019)
- Massive overhaul of code to decrease memory requirements.

Branch v1.6
(19 Nov 2019)
- Supports 0, 1, and 2 byte arguments to start command. On a start with 0
arguments, node retains previous sampling period.

(15 Nov 2019)
- Added query command for transmit statistics:
-- Send 'QS' to node
-- Replies 'QS'[tx count][tx_failed]
--- both tx_count and tx_failed are 2 bytes each, MSB sent first
--- both counters are reset on a start command
- Now catching transmit status frames from sense, start, stop, and query
- Added start acknowledge (node replies "SA" after start)

(14 Nov 2019)
- Added flash memory support (save and load during boot):
-- Node ID
-- Node Loc
-- Pan ID
-- Channel
-- Aggregator Address (unicast_addr)
-- Sampling rate

Branch v1.5
(31 Oct 2019)
- Added sleep on timer state (tx: 'Z'[time_hi][time_lo])
-- Still need to implement boot-up setting of SM parameter (to 1 for pin
sleep)
- Added bootup states to set XBee ID parameter
-- Default parameter defined in defines_id.h (currently set to 0x7fff)
- Added bootup states to set XBee CH parameter
-- Default parameter defined in defines_id.h (currently set to 0x1a)

(30 Oct 2019)
- Added change node_id/node_loc
-- Node ID (tx: 'DI'[len][node_id])
-- Node loc (tx: 'DL'[len][node_loc])
- Added commit radio settings to XBee NVM (tx: 'DW', rx: 'QWR')

Branch v1.4
(22 Oct 2019)
- Added remote query: unicast addr (tx: 'QA', rx: 'QA[val]'  
- Added remote query: power level (tx: 'QP', rx: 'QPL[val]'

Branch v1.3
(21 Oct 2019)
- Added capability to change aggregator(unicast) address.
- Changed reply address for debug unicast to address of node that sent the
debug command

(18 Oct 2019)
- Allowed entry to normal sensing mode (continuous sensing until stopped) from
the debug state (by sending a start packet)
- Re-enabled window state to receive stop signal. Upon receiving the stop
signal, node returns to debug state
- Added stop acknowlege state and packet (b'XA'). After issuing a stop
command, node should transmit a stop acknowledge to unicast address
(handshake)
