Branch v1.5
(31 Oct 2019)
- Added sleep on timer state (tx: 'Z'[time_hi][time_lo])
-- Still need to implement boot-up setting of SM parameter (to 1 for pin
sleep)
- Added bootup states to set XBee ID parameter
-- Default parameter defined in defines_id.h (currently set to 0x7fff)
- Added bootup states to set XBee CH parameter
-- Default parameter defined in defines_id.h (currently set to 0x1a)

(30 Oct 2019)
- Added change node_id/node_loc
-- Node ID (tx: 'DI'[len][node_id])
-- Node loc (tx: 'DL'[len][node_loc])
- Added commit radio settings to XBee NVM (tx: 'DW', rx: 'QWR')

Branch v1.4
(22 Oct 2019)
- Added remote query: unicast addr (tx: 'QA', rx: 'QA[val]'  
- Added remote query: power level (tx: 'QP', rx: 'QPL[val]'

Branch v1.3
(21 Oct 2019)
- Added capability to change aggregator(unicast) address.
- Changed reply address for debug unicast to address of node that sent the
debug command

(18 Oct 2019)
- Allowed entry to normal sensing mode (continuous sensing until stopped) from
the debug state (by sending a start packet)
- Re-enabled window state to receive stop signal. Upon receiving the stop
signal, node returns to debug state
- Added stop acknowlege state and packet (b'XA'). After issuing a stop
command, node should transmit a stop acknowledge to unicast address
(handshake)
