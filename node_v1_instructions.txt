== How to Program Nodes ==

1. Clone from github repo:
   - URL: https://github.com/snapdensing/node_v1.git
   - Repository is set to private. You must have a github account and you must inform Snap and ask for permissions

2. New CCS Project
   - Target: MSP430x2xx Family - MSP430F2132
   - Empty Project
   - Location: Directory where you cloned

3. Debug to program

== Node configuration == 

All configuration must be done on compile. You only need to edit two files for this:
  - defines.h
  - main.c

To make the node broadcast instead of unicast (to an aggregator):
  - Make sure #define BROADCAST line is uncommented in defines.h

To edit attached sensors (and packet information):
  - Uncomment desired sensors in "Sensor Configuration" section of defines.h

To change unicast address:
  - Look for the "Constant Addresses" section in main.c and edit the value of string "unicast_addr"
